How to Build Rapid SCADA
------------------------
Microsoft Visual Studio 2022 is needed. Visual Studio Community is OK.

1. Download the source code from the repository:
   https://github.com/RapidScada/scada-v6

2. Build the solutions using Visual Studio in the following sequence:
   ScadaCommon,
   ScadaAgent,
   ScadaComm,
   ScadaServer,
   ScadaWeb,
   ScadaAdmin,
   OpenDrivers,
   OpenDrivers2,
   OpenExtensions,
   OpenModules,
   OpenPlugins.

   Switch to the Release configuration so that the references are correct.

3. Enjoy the binaries built by yourself.
